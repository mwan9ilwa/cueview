# CueView - Final Implementation Status

## âœ… COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

All requested features have been implemented and the app is now fully functional. The final implementation includes:

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Implemented

1. **Advanced TV Show Progress Tracking**
   - Episode-level progress tracking with `WatchedEpisode` model
   - Season-level progress tracking with `SeasonProgress` model
   - Backend integration with Firestore for persistent storage
   - UI components for marking episodes as watched/unwatched

2. **Robust Library Management**
   - Enhanced `EnhancedLibraryScreenWithEpisodes` screen
   - Add/remove shows from library functionality
   - Show status management (Watching, Completed, On Hold, Dropped)
   - Rating and notes functionality for shows

3. **Working Navigation & Show Details**
   - Fixed navigation from discovery to show details
   - Real show data integration using TMDb API
   - Proper `ShowDetailScreen` with actual show information
   - Working "Add to Library" functionality with user feedback

4. **Image Loading & UI/UX**
   - Multiplatform `NetworkImage` component using Coil
   - Platform-specific implementations for Android and iOS
   - Loading states, error handling, and placeholder images
   - Modern Material Design 3 UI components

5. **Backend Integration**
   - Complete `TvShowRepositoryImpl` with TMDb API integration
   - Full `UserRepositoryImpl` with Firebase/Firestore integration
   - Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Real-time data synchronization

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

#### Data Layer
- **Models**: Enhanced with episode/season progress, reminders, user preferences
- **Repository**: Implemented `TvShowRepositoryImpl` and `UserRepositoryImpl`
- **API Service**: Complete TMDb API integration with proper DTOs and mappers
- **Firebase**: Full Firestore integration for user data persistence

#### Domain Layer  
- **Use Cases**: Progress tracking, recommendations, discovery, show management
- **Repository Interfaces**: Clean architecture with proper abstractions
- **Business Logic**: Episode tracking algorithms, recommendation engine

#### Presentation Layer
- **ViewModels**: `ShowDetailViewModel`, `LibraryViewModel`, `DiscoverViewModel`
- **Screens**: Enhanced discover, library, and detail screens
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with proper state management
- **Navigation**: Working navigation between all screens

#### Cross-Platform Setup
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin configuration with all required modules
- **Multiplatform**: Proper common/platform-specific code organization
- **Build Configuration**: Working Gradle setup for Kotlin Multiplatform

### ðŸš€ Build & Deployment Status

- âœ… **Compilation**: All code compiles successfully without errors
- âœ… **Build**: Clean build completes successfully (`./gradlew clean assembleDebug`)
- âœ… **Installation**: APK installs successfully on Android devices/emulators
- âœ… **Dependencies**: All required dependencies properly configured
- âœ… **Code Quality**: No duplicate files, proper error handling, clean architecture

### ðŸŽ¯ Feature Verification

#### 1. Episode/Season Progress Tracking âœ…
- Backend logic implemented in `UserRepositoryImpl`
- Firestore integration for persistent storage
- UI components for marking episodes watched/unwatched
- Season completion tracking

#### 2. Error Handling & Retry Logic âœ…
- Smart error messages in ViewModels
- Retry functionality with up to 3 attempts
- Loading states and user feedback
- Network error handling

#### 3. UI/UX Improvements âœ…
- Loading overlays during operations
- Success/Error snackbars for user feedback
- Retry buttons for failed operations
- Modern Material Design 3 components
